##Webcomics++##


Webcomics like [SMBC](http://www.smbc-comics.com/) have nice keyboard shortcuts for easily navigating between the comics.  

This extension adds that feature (and others) into some other webcomics.

Keys:  
Z = previous comic  
C = next comic  
X = random comic (not always supported)  
Y = switch to permalink (not always needed)  

Supported Webcomics:  
[Commit Strip](www.commitstrip.com)  
[XKCD](www.xkcd.com)  
[Bug Martini](www.bugmartini.com)  
[Ctrl-Alt-Delete](http://www.cad-comic.com/)
