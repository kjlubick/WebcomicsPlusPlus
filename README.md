##Webcomics++##


Webcomics like [SMBC](http://www.smbc-comics.com/) have nice keyboard shortcuts for easily navigating between the comics.  

This extension adds that feature (and others) into some other webcomics.

Keys:  
Z = previous comic  
C = next comic  
X = random comic (not always supported)  
Y = switch to permalink (not always needed)  

Supported Webcomics:  
[Commit Strip](www.commitstrip.com)  
[XKCD](www.xkcd.com)  
[Bug Martini](www.bugmartini.com)
[Ctrl-Alt_Delete](http://www.cad-comic.com/)
[Cyanide and Happiness](http://explosm.net/)
[The Doghouse Diaries](http://thedoghousediaries.com/)
[Piled Higher and Deeper](http://phdcomics.com/comics.php)
[Awkward Zombie](http://www.awkwardzombie.com/)
